Today I just barely managed to stick to my first week goal of taking it easy until my legs get under me. 

I woke up just before the (excellent) sunrise to a “nice spot” murmured by a passing hiker. I forgot to brush my teeth.

The morning hiking was divine: no sun and a cool 65 degrees. Very quickly the sun was killing me as I began an interminable traverse just below a ridge to begin a long descent towards Hauser creek. During this descent I finally started socializing with other hikers, as I saw very few yesterday. After making it over the next pass I spent far too long at the Lake Morena campground with several of these people, not realizing that I was setting myself up (again) to hike through the heat of the day.

Alas. I set off alone but within the hour caught up with the next group. Coincidentally I got along much better with them—a man from Spain, one from Maine, one from Nebraska (Tinder), a couple who live in Colorado (Moxie and Steamboat), and a girl from Belgium. Tinder stopped to meet me while the others went ahead. We immediately hit it off and after hearing my grad school travails he said that he had a very good feeling about Rice. We set off and, hours later, I turned on my data to see that indeed minutes after he said this I was accepted. I’m feeling pretty stoked. 

I really liked this group, so even though I had much more in the tank after the very kind Boulder Oaks campground host gave us her thirty minute speech :), I decided to stay the night with them at the campground. I’m hoping Tinder will decide to power towards the French restaurant at the summit of Mount Laguna (!!!!) with me to get a late lunch and wait out the heat before doing the big descent. Ending the day at mile 26.0 for a hair under 18 miles on the day.
