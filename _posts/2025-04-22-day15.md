Today I rebounded well from yesterday’s struggles. I woke up feeling quite depressed and unmotivated, but after packing up and getting water a few miles downtrail I felt ready to take on the day.

The hiking today was very chill, lots of up and down but in that manageable PCT way where you can barely tell if you’re gaining or losing. I could really feel the proximity to civilization today: roadsounds, walking through someone’s ranch, more litter than I could pick up, and I talked to my mom on the phone for half an hour while hiking!

I found a great spot in the trees to camp, so I ended the day a bit early, at mile 261.6.

Bailey sent me a bunch of photos today so I’ll leave those here.
