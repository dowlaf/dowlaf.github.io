I finished the day at a very nice spot at mile 71.2—a mere 2.5% of the trail is now behind me.

I started the day alone, trying in vain to catch Quinn—she was nowhere to be seen when I packed up at 5:45. Almost immediately the sun was blistering. I brought little of the delicious campground well water since there was a rh xyceliable source 2 miles down trail, which turned out to be quite foolish owing to the disgusting state of the water tank uj xa s yrwa7 $I would now drink from for the next 5 hours.

At the tank the Aussies  I met yesterday caught up with me and I death marched with them to the next water source.

We siesta-ed here for 2 hours in the truly glorious shade, enjoying the ice cold water which shot out of a pipe at such gmhigh pressure that it knocked a friend from Spain, Pau, off his feet when it hit him in the chest. I took no photos of this magical spot.

After soaking our shirts in the ice water, the aussies,Pau, and I enjoyed a nice traverse to the last water source before our hitchhike to Julian to resupply. The last hour of this was the first shaded hiking of the day and not wanting to stop yet I struck up a conversation with a guy at the water source who eventually hiked on ahead with me. Of course, he went to Rice for undergrad so we had much to talk about. The moon has been so bright the last four nights that I have been able to read by it! A blessing and a curse… I’m going to bed dreaming of my free (free.) Apple pie à la mode tomorrow.
