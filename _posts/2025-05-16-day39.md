Double zero! In order to hike with new friends, we stayed another day in Kennedy Meadows. Totally unnecessary for my body, but it was pretty awesome nonetheless. I ate another huge pancake breakfast, rolled out my feet, and chatted with everybody until it was time for me to eat a huge burger for lunch. Afterwards we did an hour of yoga led by an Irish man who appeared out of the woodwork to lead us through the best recovery yoga of all time. Then I ate a pint of Ben and Jerry’s and a salad as preparation for a lovely swim in the freezing Kern river. Then dinner (chicken nuggets and mashed potatoes with Fritos) and Airplane! on the General Store’s big screen. Great day. I’m very excited for a big first day in the high Sierra tomorrow!
