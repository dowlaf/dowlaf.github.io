Rough one today. I ended at little bear’s “hostel” at around mile 145.2 for 25.6 miles on the day. Bailey and I woke up to a crisp morning, and the weather stayed that way for most of the day—lows 70s and partly sunny.

We hiked to the first water source, a well-fed tank on trail angel Mike’s property, without issue and realized this would be our last water for 18 miles, i.e. the rest of the day. I contemplated my heavy pack while Bailey enjoyed the hospitalities of the water man—bean and cheese burritos, beer, and a truly disgusting toilet. In fact, it was during my time on this toilet that Julian, the closest town, experienced a magnitude 5.2 earthquake. I didn't notice. We set off but quickly I realized my relatively neglected feet were quite unhappy. We part ways for me to treat my wounds, and it turns out we wouldn’t meet until night.

Midday into the afternoon turned into quite the sufferfest, with my pack at its heaviest and my feet quite swollen from the heat in far too narrow shoes. I encountered more snakes than I can count, with three rattling at me from unseen locations in the course of 5 minutes.

Less than half a mile from the turn off to the hostel, I tossed my pack down and contemplated the depth of my suffering. Then I ate a heath bar and practically ran to get the soda, hot dogs, and chips that FarOut promised. Lots of nice people here so it was a nice end to a tough one. Tomorrow: paradise valley cafe, legendary PCT burger joint.
