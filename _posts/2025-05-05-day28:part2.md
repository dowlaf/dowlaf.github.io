I finished all of my town chores by 5 and we decided that we would aim to leave by 6. I napped in a beautifully sunrise -dappled lawn until 5:45. After dealing with food, water, and feet, we set off at 6:30, at least two hours behind the most recent person to have left Hiker Town.

We were treated with a brief uncovered view of the aqueduct as the sun began to set. During sunset we walked on top of the covered aqueduct to get the best view. This was among the best parts of the evening.

Soon we were surrounded by Joshua Trees for the first time on trail (aside from a few scattered sightings) and the sun was really down.

Soon after, we cracked our glow sticks and the very bright waxing half moon was turned on. Good to go.

We ate dinner at 9:30 behind a concrete slab which served to block the brutal wind. Here Compass caught up with us. He’s a very interesting older guy from Idaho who was pursuing a very strange night-hiking schedule (which turned out to be pretty effective). We soon caught up with him while he was setting up camp for the night on top of another slab.

I have no more photos because it was too dark, despite there being enough moon to for us to have shadows. Thus I’ll make the ending short: we walked until about midnight, when we both suddenly decided we could walk no further. Camp was set up in minutes and we were asleep by 12:15, ending the day at Mile 531.0.
