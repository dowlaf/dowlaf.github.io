Today I flew from Chicago to San Diego and after messing around with the southbound bus system and two rideshares I made it to the southern terminus monument. I’ll spare the gory details.

I started hiking at about 2pm: the heat of the day. It was 84 degrees and there was not a cloud in the sky. My nerves from the past few days washed away immediately and I was able to enjoy my toasty hike. This trail is pretty strange in how well-maintained it is—almost comically so:

It will be pretty tough to get lost. I ended up hiking about 8.2 miles, a very short afternoon jaunt, because I found a 5-star campsite that I couldn’t pass up:

I’m enjoying a big bar of dark chocolate and waiting for my Cuban rice and beans to rehydrate as a I write this, so I’m a happy camper.
