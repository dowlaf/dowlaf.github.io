The weather cooperated with us today to enable a long and pleasant day of walking, ending at Mile 510.9 for a bit over a marathon (though less than that for trail miles, since one of our water sources was an off-trail adventure).

We started the morning with a 3000 foot climb out of the Lake Hughes valley to our first water source—a rain-fed tank about a mile off trail. In between was the eerily new Sawmill Campground, where we enjoyed a luxuriously long lunch and finally dried our stuff in the sun. Here’s what the tank looks like:

After lunch we walked further uphill, much of it through absolutely beautiful and verdant forest.

This was a welcome change from the long stretches of recent burn scar we would walk through today, the bit after lunch caused by the 2021 Lake Fire (I couldn’t figure out what caused the first). Both burn scars were  absolutely covered in Poodle Dog Bush, a plant so irritating to the skin that our speed probably dropped to nearly two miles per hour to avoid it.

We ended the day descending through absolutely stunning meadows. We saw so much green today.

We’re just a few miles outside Hiker Town, where we plan to buy a bit more food, shower, and siesta all day in preparation for our LA Aqueduct night hike. Fun stuff.
