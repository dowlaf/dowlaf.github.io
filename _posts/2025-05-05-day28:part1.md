Just seven miles outside of Hiker Town, last night we planned to get to bed early, and try to sleep in late. Unfortunately, rain ruined our cowboy camp so that we had to set up shelters and l, after setting up my tarp, was just not tired. This led to very little sleep, though we did luxuriate in camp, breakfasting and drying our gear in the hot sun, until 9:30 (a time when I usually have walked nearly ten miles!).

The walk in to Hiker Town was uneventful: hot and pretty.

Hiker Town is a weird place: imagine if the fake western town from *Blazing Saddles* had been converted into a backpacker hostel. We had an incredibly needed shower and a burger at the nearby shop. Thereâ€™s a lot to say, but a nap is calling my name so I will leave it at that.

Stay tuned for part 2, when Road Runner, me, and hopefully a few others night hike the twenty four mile Los Angeles Aqueduct stretch of trail!
