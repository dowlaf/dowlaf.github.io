Today we did zero mileage and just relaxed in Idyllwild—big breakfast, pint of Ben and Jerry’s for post breakfast snack, finished the book I’ve been lugging around and not reading while munching on some carrots, made a bunch of phone calls, watched Kill Bill vol. 1, and had a massive lasagna dinner cooked by a friend. I also met the mayor of Idyllwild:
