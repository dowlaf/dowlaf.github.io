Today we ended up at a campground in Mount Laguna just off trail from mile 47.6. A solid day of walking. It was mostly uphill and mostly in the blistering sun, so it was tough and fun.

I started off walking alone and cleared out of the valley before the sun was above the ridge to my east. I skipped this pretty water source which turned out to be a misjudgment.

Fortunately, after a blistering traverse on the eastern side of a ridge, Tinder caught up with me and had lots of water to spare. This was not before I finally came across the family of 9â€“7 children from 1 to 13 (I think) I had been anticipating for the prior two days. The kids looked miserable, with the oldest not even lifting his head to mutter his hello in response to my greeting. As expected, the mom spoke and moved like a lunatic and the dad, in addition to a kid on his back and two packs in his hands, had a massive pack and the 1 year old strapped to him. He looked the most miserable of all. I took some stalker shots:

We had a long water break at a poor spot where Tinder and I found basically the only natural shade for a few miles around. This is when we first met Quinn, who I ended up hiking with a bit later.

Finally, after so long, we made it to the top of Mount Laguna and dined at the French restaurant at the top. The couple who ran it were delighted to speak French with me, but, as with everyone else, put off by the price of the many genuinely French dishes they offered, I ordered a burger. Yum. Afterwards Quinn and I sallied forth towards the campground, earning our first truly excellent view in the process:

Though I had much more in the tank for today, I decided to avoid camping illegally on the other side of Mount Laguna and continue to hangout with the same group, albeit at an overpriced campground.
