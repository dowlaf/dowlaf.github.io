We woke up at 5:30 in our wet little meadow for an understatedly beautiful sunrise which crescendoed just before 6.

Soon after we began moving, we realized that we would now pay the karmic price for yesterday’s extravagance and pleasure with very demoralizing weather—fog limited our views to ten to one hundred feet in front of us, the wind blasted at us made anything but moving quite cold, and the lack of sun meant that our soggy sleeping bags from the night before would remain so for the coming night. Despite this, we maintained good spirits and stomped out the fifteen miles to the first water source by 11:30. We ended up spending an hour at this water source, a spigot outside a fire station, enjoying lunch (tortillas with peanut butter and either brownie chunks or kettle chips for me) and avoiding making our next move.

After amusing ourselves watching the firemen in training learn to sharpen their axes via the pedagogical methods used for fraternity-hazing, we got back on trail. We found ourselves pretty mentally tired—having only slept five-ish hours the night before. We took copious breaks during the five miles climb to our water source, and, after each taking a nap on the sandy shores of an unmarked stream, we decided to stop here for the day. Though it was only 4 pm, we still managed to walk 22 miles to end at Mile 485.7. This will give us good timing for getting into Hiker Town to siesta before our very exciting aqueduct night hike in two days. Below are the photos I took during the only sun of the day, a thirty minute interval after 10 am.
