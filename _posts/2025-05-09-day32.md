Today we made two crucial errors which combined to make a few hours of the day quite the sufferfest. The first was actually decided last night, namely that we cut in two an otherwise 20 mile water carry by taking a 1 mile side trail to a spring. This was pretty dumb for two reasons: first, we failed to realize that the water was one mile and 700 feet straight down a rocky Jeep road, and two, we didn’t understand that the 40 minute round trip to collect the water (plus time for filtering) would just need to be made up during the hottest part of the day. Hot indeed, as today marked the first day of a heatwave which we will suffer at least through the weekend.

The second mistake was not waking up early enough; when my alarm went off at 5, I wasn’t very quick to move after a poor night of sleep, and Roadrunner was still asleep in her tent. We weren’t walking until 6, way too late of a start to meet our goal of walking the 20 miles to the Robin Bird Spring prior to siesta time. Alas, we suffered the consequences later in the day as we were forced to walk uphill the entire way under the brutal Mojave sun and with a hot, yes hot, breeze in our faces. I’ll spare the unpleasant details of this part of the day and just share a few photos I took.

We finally made it to the spring at 2:30. I drenched myself in water, ate an inordinate amount of food (my appetizer was half a pound of summer sausage), stretched, and tried to take a nap. Unfortunately the loudest talking man on trail appeared soon after I closed my eyes, so my nap attempt was for naught. We finally hiked out at around 5:30, and the ponderosa pine forest we found ourselves in was so nice that we decided to stop around 7 at a nice flat spot half a mile off trail from Mile 607.5, for 30 miles on the day including all the side quests.
