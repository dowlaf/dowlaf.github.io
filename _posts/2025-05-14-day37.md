Waking up this morning, I experienced the full pain of poor campsite selection. Overnight temperatures were in the 20s, so with no protection from condensation the inside of my bivy looked like this:

Fortunately, I was able to quickly shake off the morning chill during the easy descent into Kennedy Meadows. We got a hitch to Grumpyâ€™s Retreat, the tavern where our packages awaited us, very quickly. I consumed an absurdly large burger, but their ice cream machine was broken, so I never felt quite sated.

After fussing with our gear and food, showering, andoing laundry, we decided to take a zero day tomorrow (my second so far) to do more research on the snowy 90 miles (plus a potential side trip to a very early-season Mount Whitney summit attempt) to our next resupply point.
