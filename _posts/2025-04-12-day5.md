Though I only hiked 20 miles (ended at mile 91.2), today was a big day. I woke up early to a nice sunrise and was walking by 6. After stoping in town, I didn’t stop walking until the sun was down, around 7:30.

The hitchhike into Julian was easy since a trail angel (such a dorky term) was waiting for me at Scissors Crossing. She drove me and the second Rice alumnus I have met in the last 24 hours to a killer breakfast:

After resupplying and replacing some busted gear, I went and demolished my free pie. Feeling stir crazy and not wanting to eat anymore, I hitched back to trail with a nice couple and started a very tough segment of trail during the heat of the day. I passed only one hiker (and his cute dog) who was also dumb enough to hike in the heat. According to the people at the water source I was the first to show up in 3 or 4 hours… 

I had two successive snake encounters, the first of which was pretty malevolent—it hissed and rattled very hard, and before this even registered I had ran 100 feet down trail. Sometimes it’s nice to be a mammal. Here are some photos from this section.
