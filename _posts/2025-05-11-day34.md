What we wanted to do two days ago (day 32) we achieved today: we were moving at 4:45 and grinding out the day’s climb by 7:15. This made it all easy, and we made it to our siesta 23 miles down trail from camp by noon. Not a bad morning.

We siesta’d until 3, around which we realized that we would rather spend the night in town at famously good trail angel Sergio’s house than at a BLM campground near the somewhat busy road over Walker Pass. Having wasted time, we ripped the eight mile walk to Walker Pass in a hair over two hours, during which time we got our first real look at the Sierra.

We got picked up at the road at Mile 653.2 (though my phone says I walked 33 miles today) by Sergio, the trail angel whose house we are staying at tonight in Ridgecrest. His frightening driving and lack of seatbelts were more than made up for by his charm and funny stories, not to mention his generosity with his time and space! Dinner was a big pizza and an ice cream sundae. Tomorrow: resupply, breakfast, and back on trail towards Kennedy Meadows South. Crazy to think that I was originally planning on getting off trail here…
