Today I woke up ready to crush the 6000 feet of elevation gain needed to set us up to nearo into Kennedy Meadows South tomorrow. Roadrunner not so much. This lack of enthusiasm was compounded by the very gray, cloudy, windy, and cold morning.

The last picture is the cloud we climbed into. Despite all this humdrum, I was feeling energetic and my body as feeling great, so I had a great time. At the top of this climb, we had our first run in with a big group from a local high school. The descent was insanely windy, so we donned our wind gear and hauled ass to the campground where we would lunch.

I have really enjoyed the seeing the environment slowly change as we approach the High Sierra; the ascent after lunch was mostly through a beautiful oak forest, an uncommon sight for the last 700 miles. Anyways, by the time we reached the top we were pretty spent and looking for a campsite. Wind protection was the key quality, and we found it by descending half a mile off trail around Mile 692 to an old mining road with a road cut that offered some protection from the eastward wind. I enjoyed my standard dinner with my second avocado and the rest of the lime. Yum.
