Today we took things extremely easy with an 8 miles hike to Paradise Valley Cafe, 5 hours and 2 meals there, then another 8 miles to a campsite for a short day ending at mile 159.7.

After waking up to little bear’s blue heeled licking my face, me. Bailey, and our new friends started hiking at a blistering pace to get our town food as soon as possible.

We ate two full meals at PVC, the first of which—a chocolate milkshake, 3 eggs, a half pound sausage patty, hashbrowns, and toast—I ate most of before the waitress could even bring out the rest of the plates. Some manners 

During breakfast I realize that because of a potential storm on San Jacinto Thursday and Friday, Bailey and I either needed to skip Idyllwild or take it easy the next two days and take a zero day on Friday. We opted for the second option after much peer pressure from our friends who were doing the same. Lunch was a massive burger which I couldn’t finish, so I packed it out for a delicious pre dinner snack at camp.

We left to suffer the afternoon heat just before they closed at 3. It was quite pretty but ended with the worst water source yet: straight down a rock strewn trail which undid all the elevation we had gained that afternoon, we found an algae-filled tub with the strongest imaginable sulfur smell. Yum.
