Today we experienced all four seasons, apparently very characteristic of the Mojave. We planned to do a short day in order to hit a quick midday resupply in Agua Dulce on Friday. Despite spending a long time in camp eating breakfast in bed and doing yoga, we crushed the first ten miles so effortlessly that we decided to push a bit further to Acton to resupply and enjoy the delights of the 49ers Saloon.

This first climb was pleasantly cool, and the same persisted as we headed to a water cache at the North Fork ranger station. Even better than the water (which we didn’t need) was the Rice Krispy Treat and cold Coke we were greeted with on arrival. This of course prompted another break, this time with quite a large and fun group.

When we left to continue our massive descent (6k today, with 3k up), we were hit with some massive and very unexpected heat. I felt some beginning heat stroke signs, slowed down and chugged electrolytes + water, plugged in my headphones to blast Sun Kil Moon, and felt better almost immediately. Soon thereafter I fell comically hard, ripping my pants and covering myself in dirt. I fantasized all day about ditching my pants for the first time, and I’m taking this as a sign to look for some shorts. The rest of the descent was much better and I was able to enjoy the fabulous views as I descended precipitously towards Acton.

Once at the road, we walked through a very bizarre RV park to find a safe place to hitchhike into town. The location was the only safe thing about our hitch into town in the back of a truck bed, which was ultimately quite fun. 

The 49ers saloon was a delight: humongous burger and root beer float, free (ie donation based) camping, shower, laundry, and toilet.   Unfortunately it rained pretty hard, forcing me to pitch my tarp and solidly my desire to stay at 49ers rather than getting back on trail tonight. Town chores (mainly resupplying and figuring out my next resupply location and timeframe) were a bore and made more difficult by a power outage from the storm which prevented me from eating a grocery store salad. Perhaps for breakfast. All in all an excellent day, ending off trail from Mile 444.3.
