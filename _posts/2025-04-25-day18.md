Today was quite fun. I’ve entered a new bubble so I have met lots and lots of people the past two days. The trail today was very easy, almost all downhill, which is reflected in my high mileage (28 miles according to the map, I’ve setup camp right next to the trail at mile 313.4) despite the fact that I spent 2 hours at an incredible hot springs.

The weather today was super nice—sunny but around 60 degrees with a strong breeze up the canyon. This made the never-ending traverse along Deep Creek painless.

Walking along the creek, I had to carry very little water and thus my pack was light. I think I used the hipbelt for no more than an hour of walking. The creek had many pools ripe for a wade, but because I wasn’t too hot I decided to wait for the famous Deep Creek Hot Springs.

The hot springs were incredible, with one large social pool, a few more secluded pools, and the cool creek right there. Exactly who you expect to meet at such a place were there: two Burning Man official fire breathers, a local guy with a perfectly manicured white beard teaching his navel, a leathery guy who had been there a week and was lecturing nonstop about anything and everything (microdosing poison oak so that he could run naked without fear, goat milk, cults he was part of and cults he narrowly avoided, society in general and c.), alongside several PCT hikers. Every stereotype of SoCal weirdo was present. While our lecturer described how this spring is actually an ancient vortex, I realized that I was absolutely baking in the sun. After scrambling out, drying off, and taping my feet, I realized I had been there for over two hours. A vortex indeed.

I hiked five more miles and found a nice spot by the creek just as the light died out. The trees are quite creaky and, though not dead, make me think it’s timberrrr everyone the wind gusts. If you’re reading this, then I’m probably alive.
