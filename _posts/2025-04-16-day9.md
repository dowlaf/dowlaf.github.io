Today was short in terms of mileage but not in terms of elevation gained—we went 17 miles (camp at mile 176.5) directly up the San Jacinto massif. We’ve set ourselves up nicely to nearo (near zero, zero being through hiker parlance for a zero mileage day) into Idyllwild tomorrow. Though temperatures are the lowest we’ve seen so far, I’m continuing my streak of not setting up my tarp for at least another night, and likely many more :). How could I enjoy this sunset through some nylon?

We woke up late. So late that Cool Shorts woke Bailey and I up as she left camp to start hiking. We got up fast as per usual to enjoy a cold hour or so on trail before the heat. The marine layer was beautiful all morning.

We climbed through our first true burn scar into the San Jacinto wilderness at 10 am, where many blowdowns and much steep ascent awaited.

Up up up. After taking a sublime poop, I caught up with everyone else on their way down to our water source—a spring 1 miles straight down the side of the mountain. Fun stuff.

This afternoon was the most beautiful hiking thus far. Alpine gulleys and ridges coated in massive granite boulders. I walked for a while with newly-minted geology PhD Rocksie, an absolute font of knowledge about all things rocks. Excellent views abounded.

The last two miles were across largely low angle and quite mushy snow—our first postholing! A demoralizing end to the day for some, with stragglers Rocksie and Silver Lining screaming on arrival to camp. I had fun, but it seems the pleasure I take in suffering is not as common as I expected. Here’s Bailey trying to stay warm while we all ate dinner together:
