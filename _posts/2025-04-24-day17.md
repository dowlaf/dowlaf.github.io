Back on trail, I ended the day at Mile 285.9 for a chill 20 mile day after the delights of Big Bear. I didn’t start walking until about 10 since a failure to realize we were breakfasting at a cash only establishment caused me to run around town looking for an ATM for which I could tap my phone. A fool’s errand.

The trail was mostly flat to downhill through Ponderosa Pines, so I don’t have many stunning photos to share.

After calling my dad, had a nice view back towards Big Bear lake and the mountains beyond.

I’m going to miss the cool breezes and snowy peaks as I descend 6000 feet tomorrow to the edge of the Mojave. I stopped to camp with a large trail family who were having fun. Unfortunately, their site selection was quite poor, so it will probably be a cold one for me. Hot springs to look forward to tomorrow evening.
