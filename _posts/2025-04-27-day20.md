Today was a short one because of the closure around Wrightwood for the Bridge Fire. I walked to Mile 356.2, gaining a bit over 4,000 feet in the process, only to descend several thousand to hitchhike into Wrightwood and thus halfway around the closure. This amounted to about 15 miles on trail and 21 total miles of walking.

I slept in and started the day with an absolute feast: papaya soaked in lime juice and 4 pressed pork and bean tacos from two people with stands next to the overpass, and from McDonald’s a sausage biscuit, hashbrowns, and a smoothie. How I hiked without issue or break straight up into the San Gabriel mountains is beyond me.

On the way up I passed what is apparently a legendary trainspotting location. After some excellent trail magic (Gatorade, two bags of chips, and a caramel candy) at the water cache, I began the long climb up. This was painless after yesterday’s suffering and, having been offered a very cheap bed in Wrightwood at the cache, I walked easily with the thought of another town meal, ice cream, a shower, and a bed. The views were spectacular, with the San Gabriels coming into staggering view and the San Bernardinos receding into the rear view.

After the shitty descent on a gravel road, the fourth car to pass me stopped and drove me all the way to the door of the Airbnb! I met many new people and ate copious Mexican food, so I go to bed happy.
