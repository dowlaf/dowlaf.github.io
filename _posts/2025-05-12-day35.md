Today was a very quintessential through hike day. Unfortunately, it began with a very early wake up for everyone at Sergio’s home because of our trail routine of waking up before the sun—I woke up at 5:30 and pretended to sleep until 7. Fortunately, luck changed as we soon headed to the incredible Krispy Donuts, where I deleted a chocolate long john (chocolate bar on the west coast, apparently) and a buttermilk doughnut before we could cross the street to our breakfast spot, a highly inauspicious diner attached to a cheap motel. The food turned out to be pretty solid—my French toast, eggs, and sausage were gone fast. 

After breakfast, we ambled back to Sergio’s and, eventually, caught a ride to WalMart with Violet, Scarecrow’s injured wife. Here I proceeded to buy a ridiculous amount of food for the two days to get to Kennedy Meadows South. Alas. I also bought a delicious bagged salad, kombucha, and yogurt. On the way back we stopped to get Roadrunner’s package. After eating a huge lunch and repackaging all the food, we again caught a ride with Violet, this time to the trailhead. We started hiking at 2:30.

With full packs and three liters of water, I was a bit nervous about the 2600 foot climb out of Walker Pass. Fortunately it was a classic PCT cruiser, graded so that you could push grandpa up in his chair. We climbed the first 1000 with stopping for any reason, and the next 1500 went down just as easily. Along the way we met a friendly guy heading southbound on the heels of his three immaculately trained Rottweilers.

The views up high were very good, and, though we have been in the Sierra since leaving Tehachapi, it finally felt like the mountains were becoming something else.

The descent to water was long and offered great views of the setting sun. Unfortunately I have a heel blister I neglected to deal with yesterday, so our progress was slower than usual.

We grabbed water at an unmarked creek (hopefully distinct from the nearby Joshua Tree Spring known for having a high uranium content) and pulled into camp around 8 at Mile 665.9. At camp, I prepared the best meal I have ever consumed in the backcountry: rice, refried beans with green chile, two kinds of taco seasoning, half a lime, and a perfectly ripe avocado. I will never top it.
