A very social zero day. I slept in until 6:45 and ate the hiker breakfast at Grumpy’s around 8:30: eggs, sausage, hashbrowns, and all you can eat pancakes (though almost no one eats a second).

After breakfast I napped and figured out how much food to buy at Triple Crown Outfitters next door. I also decided to bite the bullet on new shoes rather than waiting for after graduation, so I had the dreadful experience of trying on different shoes and walking up and down the shop—housed in a shipping-container—and trying to determine whether they fit or not. I didn’t like either of their options so I opted to try the other outfitter, located at the rival Kennedy Meadows General Store. Thus we made our way over there and almost instantly regretted having spent yesterday afternoon at Grumpy’s: the food was cheaper, the ambiance better, and there were just a lot of people having fun. Plus they had Ben and Jerry’s, a pint of which ended up being the appetizer to my dinner. After making several new friends who we want to hike with, we decided to move over to the general store to camp. We caught a ride back to Grumpy’s with a guy supporting his daughter, shoving eight passengers into his compact SUV fit the three mile drive.

We played frisbee for a few hours and just relaxed at the picnic tables before eating some dinner. It seems like Roadrunner and I have relented to stay at least until tomorrow afternoon so that the others can get their ducks in a row for an evening start. Though a double zero/ zero nearo situation is not what either of us wanted, it’s going to be worth it to hike with such a fun group for the next stretch.
