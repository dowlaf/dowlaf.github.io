Today was a return to form, hiking at least a marathon (my phone says 29.7 miles) to end at Mile 420.8. I woke up around 5 to a drizzle on my face which fortunately didnâ€™t persist, and I was up and moving by 5:30. After waiting for more awake people from camp to join me, we set off on the morning climb to warm up. This first climb was easy and we soon found ourselves at a piped spring where we took a luxurious thirty minute break.

After further descending, we began the long ascent of the day in the rough morning sun. The setting was pretty drab as everything had burned in the last five years or so, but the views were great.

We took a divine break at the top and I aired out my disgusting feet.

The long, long descent to the fire station below was made worse by a controlled burn nearby with the smoke heading directly towards us. We powered through and made it to water without issue. To camp, we needed to climb back up another 1000 feet. We dragged our feet a bit and considered settling on some pretty crappy campsites along the way. After some extreme indecision between us, we decided to make camp on a slight slope very protected from the brutal eastward wind. I ate a huge dinner and will now sleep well.
