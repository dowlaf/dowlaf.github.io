Tough day. The desert forces you to appreciate the little things—shade found under a boulder, a cool breeze, cold water—because that is often all that is on offer. We ended off trail at mile 218.6.

We overslept and weren’t moving down trail until 7:30. Thus our morning 6000 foot descent was in the blazing sun. Bailey and I were soon separated and I was left to fend for myself. Experiencing the early warning signs of heat stroke or dehydration, I found refuge underneath a 15 foot wide boulder. Reinvigorated after consuming copious amounts of water, salt, and my orange which froze overnight and remained frozen, I cautiously continued the descent thinking that I probably wouldn’t see Bailey until tonight.

Patience is the trait which I would most like to hone on this trip. Nothing comes quickly, so one must wait. Just so with this descent, which continued for another 2 hours of endless switchbacks over barely-descending rocky paths. Nearly at the bottom, I got in touch with Bailey and determined that he had about an hour on me. Thus when I reached the water at the bottom, I filled up then powered ahead in the hope of catching him in the long flat section between the base of San Jacinto and the I-10 “oasis.”

Having descended to about 1200 feet above sea level, it was hot. Nonetheless, I felt great and I powered towards the oasis across the San Gorgonio riverbed-wasteland—I knew that a special snack awaited me.

When I arrived at the oasis (a pile of trash and shitty advertisements for trail “angel” services under an I-10 underpass), fiendish to bust out my snack, Bailey greeted me much to my surprise. We caught up while also getting to know the two unscrupulous Dutch men who told us they lived here. I ate my partially-frozen honey crisp apple topped with chocolate-peanut butter with glee. 

Shortly before we left, trail angel Legend showed up to remove his sign and tell us that today would be the last night of spaghetti with tomato sauce and tomorrow the last morning of pancakes and coffee at Whitewater Preserve—our destination. The free food, in addition to the wading pool and beautiful, grassy camping area, were enough to put some serious wind in our sails. However, we were looking down the barrel of 2500 feet of elevation gain over 10 miles to get there. In the heat of the day.

We powered through the wind farm no problem, aided by the kind workers who left out a cooler filled with ice cold waters for PCT hikers. The uphill was tough for me and Bailey and I were again separated.

As the sun set and I descended the ridge leading to the Whitewater River alone, I realized that the time for the spaghetti dinner bell—6 pm—was rapidly approaching. I kicked things into gear and made it to the camping area at 6:30 to a round of applause (at which I laughed) from the three tables filled with through hikers and a reserved spot next to the head of the tables. Before I could take my shoes off a plate was plopped in front of me. I wish I someone took a picture of my grin.
