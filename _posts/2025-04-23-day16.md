Today I woke up early to get to Big Bear Lake and meet Bailey for breakfast at the Grizzly Manor Café. I hitched in with a very friendly guy who had never heard of the PCT.

After resupplying and shipping home my inflatable pad, my microspikes, and most of my foam pad (I cut it down to torso length), we continued to eat ourselves silly: clementines, watermelon, salad, pizza (mine with pepperoni, Italian sausage, garlic, and basil), and a quarter pound of fudge.

I deleted that pizza in 12 minutes, and the fudge an hour later. This left us in such a comatose state that we ended up in our room at the hostel by 4— done for the day. I sewed a hole in my pants, watched John Wick: Chapter 4, and slept hard.
