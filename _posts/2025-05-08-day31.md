Because we left several tasks until today, we werenâ€™t able to make it on trail until 11:30. The morning was very nice though, with yogurt, berries, and a kombucha, all things my gut has been pining for. When we did make it to trail, it was quite hot and my pack was quite heavy, probably the heaviest it has been to date.

This section begins with two miles next to the highway before gaining 4000 feet to reach around 6200 feet above sea level. We both felt quite strong on the climb so we made it to the top in about of the sustained 2500 foot climb above the highway in a few hours.

At the top we were greeted by a beautiful pine forest which offered abundant dappled sunlight. Unfortunately we were soon walking a dirt road through this area, which would continue for another four miles.

At 5:30, we made it to the first water source of the day, a delicious piped spring at Mile 583.3. Not wanting to dry camp between the spring and the next water source twenty miles away, we called it quits a bit early. This gave me the opportunity to prepare the best meal I have ever eaten while backpacking: instant rice, refried beans with green chile, very spicy taco seasoning, Fritos, and an entire avocado. I could have eaten another pot and still enjoyed my dessert of cosmic brownies and peanut butter m&ms.
