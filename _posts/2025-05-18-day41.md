Yesterday’s big day combined with the altitude caught up with me today. Fortunately the same thing happened for Roadrunner and Beer Run, so my 15 mile day to end at Mile 746.5 is a little less embarrassing. 

I slept very little last night, probably because of the altitude. Fortunately I stayed warm, so I don’t have too much to complain about. The first few miles were flat and easy, but soon we were climbing and I was feeling my heart beat harder than anytime in the past forty days on trail. I took it easy and soon caught up with the rest of the group for a snack with Sarah and DJ, who got a headstart on us from their campsite a few miles behind ours.

Soon we were up and over this first climb and I was already gassed, despite only being seven miles in. It was mostly downhill to the spot for lunch, so I cruised down while thinking of an easier plan for the day than what the others were intending.

Lunch was long and luxurious, and we all stupidly worked on our sun tans here at 10,000 feet.

Roadrunner and Beer Run jumped at my easier plan—4 miles less and camp at 10,400 feet, almost 1k lower than what the others planned—so we mosied up and made camp at around 4:30. Early dinner and early to bed will help us immensely with tomorrow’s big day—4 am start for the twenty two mile hike to the base camp of our Whitney summit attempt in two days  time. I ate a delicious dinner of ramen and Landoaeger sausage, followed by copious amounts of dark chocolate.
